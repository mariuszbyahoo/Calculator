# Calculator
Simple calculator written in Java with a GUI made in Java Swing. Uses BigDecimal to achieve a mathematical precision

This program needs to make an each calculation step by step. For example:
1+3+4-5*2 = x 
Arithmetically, the x variable should be x =(-2), but this app will present the result of a last two numbers.
So the program's response will be x = 10.   

In order to make a complex calculations you need to calculate them in arithmeticall order, for example: 3 + 4 * 2 - (3-1) = first, count 4 * 2 = 8 secondary, 3 + multiply result (8) = 11 next, calculate tha bracelet result 3-1 = 4 then subtract a bracelet result from the left side of the statement
 11 - 4 = 7
 Voila, your result = 11!

You do not have to worry about a result like 3,33333(3) because the program will round it  to 3,33
